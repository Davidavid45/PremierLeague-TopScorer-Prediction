# PremierLeague-TopScorer-Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the top goal scorers in the Premier League at the end of a season using mid-season data. We utilized various predictive models, including statistical and machine learning techniques, to analyze player performance metrics.

## Steps Involved

### 1. Data Collection
- **Source:** We gathered mid-season data for Premier League players, including historical data spanning multiple seasons.
- **Features:** Player statistics like goals, assists, shots on target, minutes played, and other relevant metrics.

### 2. Data Preparation
- **Scripting:** Data cleaning and preprocessing were performed in Python and R. Missing values were imputed, and outliers were handled to ensure data quality.
- **Feature Engineering:** Created new features like goals per game, shot conversion rate, and expected goals (xG).

### 3. Model Selection
We used multiple models to ensure robust predictions:
- **Linear Regression:** To establish a baseline for predictions.
- **Random Forest:** For capturing non-linear relationships and feature importance.
- **Boosting Models:** To optimize predictions by correcting weak learners iteratively.
- **Neural Networks:** For advanced modeling to capture complex patterns in the data.

### 4. Model Comparison
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Models were evaluated using RMSE, accuracy, and precision. 
- **Best Model:** The Boosting model outperformed others with an RMSE of 1.29 and an accuracy of 55.75%.

### 5. Visualization
- **Tools:** Visualizations were created using Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to display trends, feature importance, and prediction outcomes.
- **Insights:** Key predictors included goals per game, shot accuracy, and minutes played.

### 6. Deployment
- The results were summarized in a report and presentation slides.
- A reproducible codebase was created to allow others to replicate the analysis.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages:** Python, R
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, TensorFlow (for Neural Networks)
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebooks, RMarkdown
